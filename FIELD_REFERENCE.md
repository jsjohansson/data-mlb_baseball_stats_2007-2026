| `Age` | `age` | As of June 30 of the season in question. |
| `IP` | `p_ip` | Innings Pitched |
| `G` | `p_g` | Games Pitched |
| `GS` | `p_gs` | Games Started |
| `R` | `p_r` | Runs Allowed |
| `RA9` | `p_ra9` | Runs Allowed Per 9 IP - This is like ERA, but with unearned runs included. |
| `RA9opp` | `p_ra9_opp` | Opponents’ Runs Scored Per 9 Inn - The average number of runs scored by this pitcher's opposition, per 9 innings. We use park factors to convert the opponent scoring to a league-average context.For in progress seasons, we consider the teams’ last 365 days. Interleague road games are excluded from the avg, and when the pitcher faces an interleague opp at home, we modify the opponent run scoring by .20 runs per 9inning depending on whether the DH is added or removed from their lineup. We assume a league average pitcher would allow this many runs. |
| `RA9def` | `p_ra9_def` | Runs per 9 IP of support from defense - This is based on the team’s Baseball Info Solutions Defensive Runs Saved since 2003 and Total Zone Rating before that. Negro League seasons use Defensive Regression Analysis. Positive values mean the team defense was above average. Negative means it was below average. We take the team’s total balls in play, the balls in play for this pitcher and the team’s total runs saved and split the runs among all of the team’s pitchers. |
| `RA9role` | `p_ra9_role` | Runs per 9 IP difference for SP and RP - From 1960 on we assess factor for starters and relievers. In that time, relievers have averaged a much lower ERA, and this factor accounts for that difference. Previously, this was part of our replacement level calculation, but it has now been moved into Runs Above Avg. |
| `PPFp` | `p_ppf_custom` | Park Factor customized for parks the pitcher threw in - From 1908 on, we have full gamelogs, so we can say exactly how many innings a pitcher threw in each park. These are 3-year park factors weighted by batters faced in each park. Note the one-game park factor is the team PPF/100 minus 1 times two plus one, since the factors on team pages are for home and road games combined. |
| `RA9avg` | `p_ra9_avg_pitcher` | Runs per 9 IP for an avg pitcher - Equals PPFp/100*(oppRA9 - RAdef + RArole) - This is our best estimate of what an average pitcher would do against these opponents, with this defense and in these parks. |
| `RAA` | `p_raa` | Runs better than Avg - IP*(RA9 avg - RA9)/9, then centered so the league average is always zero. - It is the number of runs this player is better than an average player. Adjusted for quality of opposition, parks pitched in and quality of team defense and recentered, so the league is zero. |
| `WAA` | `p_waa` | Wins Above Average for pitchers - A single number that presents the number of wins the player added - to the team above what a league average player would add. - Scale: 6+ MVP Quality, 3+ All-Star Quality, 0 Starter, - -2-0 Reserve, < -2 Replacement Level - Developed by Sean Smith of BaseballProjection.com |
| `gmLI` | `p_leverage_index_avg_rp` | Game-entering Leverage Index - Solely for relief appearances, this is the average of each appearances opening leverage index - weighted by the batters faced in that outing. - The average pressure the pitcher or batter saw in this game or season. - 1.0 is average pressure, below 1.0 is low pressure and above 1.0 is high pressure. |
| `WAAadj` | `p_waa_adj` | Wins Above Avg Adjustment - For relief pitchers, we multiply WAA by (1+gmLI)/2. This is done in recognition of the added importance of high leverage. WAA adj is the additional value of this leverage adjustment. Also, the manner in which this and the WAA calculations are performed cause the league total WAA to move away from zero, so we also do an operation to recenter the entire league. The recentering forces the league sum to 0 which is as it should be for Wins Above Average. So for the league as a whole, WAA+WAA adj will equal zero and WAR = WAA + WAA adj + Replacement value |
| `WAR` | `p_war` | Wins Above Replacement for Pitchers - A single number that presents the number of wins the player added - to the team above what a replacement player (think AAA or AAAA) would add. This value includes defensive support and includes additional value for high leverage situations. - Scale: 8+ MVP Quality, 5+ All-Star Quality, 2+ Starter, - 0-2 Reserve, < 0 Replacement Level - Developed by Sean Smith of BaseballProjection.com |
| `RAR` | `p_rar` | Runs better than Replacement Level - It is the number of runs this player is better than a replacement player. Replacement is set for a .294 team winning percentage. - Developed by Sean Smith of BaseballProjection.com |
| `waaWL%` | `p_waa_win_perc` | Win-Loss% w/ Avg. Team - This is the win-loss of an otherwise average team in ONLY the games this player played in. - For example, for a pitcher this would only consider the games the pitcher threw in and ignoring games they did not play in. |
| `162WL%` | `p_waa_win_perc_162` | Win-Loss% w/ Avg. Team Season - This is the win-loss of an otherwise average team for an entire season giving them credit for only the games this player played in. - For example, for a pitcher this would be waaW-L% - in the games the pitcher threw in and a .500 record otherwise. |
| `Awards` | `awards` | Awards and honours for that season as listed by Baseball-Reference (e.g. AS = All-Star, MVP-1 = MVP winner). |
| `RA9extras` | `p_ra9_extras` | Runs per 9 IP difference for pitching in extra innings - Starting in 2020, MLB had teams begin every extra inning with a runner on second base. If this runner scores, it is charged to the pitcher who started the inning. We adjust the pitcher's expected runs by the run expectancy that is added by the runner being placed on second base (approx 0.6 runs) for each time they start an extra inning. |
| `Player_ID` | `identifier/derived` | Baseball-Reference's stable player identifier - the join key across datasets. Holds the coach's id on Coaching_Staff. |

| `G` | `G` | Games Played or Pitched |
| `GS` | `GS` | Games Started |
| `R` | `R` | Runs Scored/Allowed |
| `RA9` | `runs_avg` | Runs Allowed Per 9 IP - This is like ERA, but with unearned runs included. |
| `RA9opp` | `opp_runs_avg` | Opponents’ Runs Scored Per 9 Inn - The average number of runs scored by this pitcher's opposition, per 9 innings. We use park factors to convert the opponent scoring to a league-average context.For in progress seasons, we consider the teams’ last 365 days. Interleague road games are excluded from the avg, and when the pitcher faces an interleague opp at home, we modify the opponent run scoring by .20 runs per 9inning depending on whether the DH is added or removed from their lineup. We assume a league average pitcher would allow this many runs. |
| `RA9def` | `runs_avg_defense` | Runs per 9 IP of support from defense - This is based on the team’s Baseball Info Solutions Defensive Runs Saved since 2003 and Total Zone Rating before that. Negro League seasons use Defensive Regression Analysis. Positive values mean the team defense was above average. Negative means it was below average. We take the team’s total balls in play, the balls in play for this pitcher and the team’s total runs saved and split the runs among all of the team’s pitchers. |
| `RA9role` | `runs_avg_sprp` | Runs per 9 IP difference for SP and RP - From 1960 on we assess factor for starters and relievers. In that time, relievers have averaged a much lower ERA, and this factor accounts for that difference. Previously, this was part of our replacement level calculation, but it has now been moved into Runs Above Avg. |
| `PPFp` | `PPF_custom` | Park Factor customized for parks the pitcher threw in - From 1908 on, we have full gamelogs, so we can say exactly how many innings a pitcher threw in each park. These are 3-year park factors weighted by batters faced in each park. Note the one-game park factor is the team PPF/100 minus 1 times two plus one, since the factors on team pages are for home and road games combined. |
| `RA9avg` | `runs_avg_avg_pitcher` | Runs per 9 IP for an avg pitcher - Equals PPFp/100*(oppRA9 - RAdef + RArole) - This is our best estimate of what an average pitcher would do against these opponents, with this defense and in these parks. |
| `RAA` | `runs_above_avg_pitch` | Runs better than Avg - IP*(RA9 avg - RA9)/9, then centered so the league average is always zero. - It is the number of runs this player is better than an average player. Adjusted for quality of opposition, parks pitched in and quality of team defense and recentered, so the league is zero. |
| `WAA` | `WAA` | Wins Above Avg - This is the wins added by this player above that of an average player. We compute the waaW-L% using a PythagenPat conversion and then subtract .500 and multiply by the number of games played. |
| `gmLI` | `GR_leverage_index_avg` | game-entering Leverage Index - Solely for relief appearances, this is the average of each appearances opening leverage index - weighted by the batters faced in that outing. - The average pressure the pitcher or batter saw in this game or season. - 1.0 is average pressure, below 1.0 is low pressure and above 1.0 is high pressure. |
| `WAAadj` | `WAA_adj` | Wins Above Avg Adjustment - For relief pitchers, we multiply WAA by (1+gmLI)/2. This is done in recognition of the added importance of high leverage. WAA adj is the additional value of this leverage adjustment. Also, the manner in which this and the WAA calculations are performed cause the league total WAA to move away from zero, so we also do an operation to recenter the entire league. The recentering forces the league sum to 0 which is as it should be for Wins Above Average. So for the league as a whole, WAA+WAA adj will equal zero and WAR = WAA + WAA adj + Replacement value |
| `WAR` | `WAR_pitch` | Wins Above Replacement for Pitchers - A single number that presents the number of wins the player added - to the team above what a replacement player (think AAA or AAAA) would add. This value includes defensive support and includes additional value for high leverage situations. - Scale: 8+ MVP Quality, 5+ All-Star Quality, 2+ Starter, - 0-2 Reserve, < 0 Replacement Level - Developed by Sean Smith of BaseballProjection.com |
| `RAR` | `runs_above_rep_pitch` | Runs better than Replacement Level - It is the number of runs this player is better than a replacement player. Replacement is set for a .294 team winning percentage. - Developed by Sean Smith of BaseballProjection.com |
| `waaWL%` | `waa_win_perc` | Win-Loss% w/ Avg. Team - This is the win-loss of an otherwise average team in ONLY the games this player played in. - For example, for a pitcher this would only consider the games the pitcher threw in and ignoring games they did not play in. |
| `162WL%` | `waa_win_perc_162` | Win-Loss% w/ Avg. Team Season - This is the win-loss of an otherwise average team for an entire season giving them credit for only the games this player played in. - For example, for a pitcher this would be waaW-L% - in the games the pitcher threw in and a .500 record otherwise. |
| `Salary` | `Salary` | These values may not include every bonus the player received in a season. - They are also often missing values for mid-season callups or players acquired in-season. - Post-1984 seasons are mostly complete, pre-1985 is mostly incomplete. |
| `RA9extras` | `runs_avg_extras` | Runs per 9 IP difference for pitching in extra innings - Starting in 2020, MLB had teams begin every extra inning with a runner on second base. If this runner scores, it is charged to the pitcher who started the inning. We adjust the pitcher's expected runs by the run expectancy that is added by the runner being placed on second base (approx 0.6 runs) for each time they start an extra inning. |
